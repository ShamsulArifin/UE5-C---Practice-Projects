# UE5-C++ Practice Projects

This repository contains practice projects developed using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and C++.

## Key Features & Benefits

This repository serves as a collection of practice projects designed to improve skills in:

*   Unreal Engine 5 development
*   C++ programming within the UE5 environment
*   Game development fundamentals
*   Problem-solving and implementation techniques

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

To work with these projects, you'll need the following:

*   **Unreal Engine 5:**  Download and install Unreal Engine 5 from the Epic Games Launcher.
*   **C++ Compiler:**  Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed (e.g., Visual Studio for Windows).  UE5 relies on the Visual Studio build tools.
*   **IDE (Recommended):**  Visual Studio or Rider for Unreal Engine are highly recommended for C++ development with Unreal Engine.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShamsulArifin/UE5-C---Practice-Projects.git
    ```

2.  **Open the Project in Unreal Engine:** Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `.uproject` file (if any, in the respective project folders) using the Unreal Engine Editor.  If there is no `.uproject` file, it may be a C++ module that has to be built in Visual Studio first.

3. **Build the Project (If necessary)** If there's a C++ solution file (`.sln`) you will need to open it in Visual Studio and build the project. In Visual Studio, right-click on the game project in the Solution Explorer and select "Build".

4. **Generate Project Files (If necessary):** If the project does not contain a Visual Studio solution file (`.sln`) or you want to regenerate it, right-click on the `.uproject` file and select "Generate Visual Studio project files." Then open the generated `.sln` file and build the project.

5.  **Explore and Experiment:** Once the project is open in Unreal Engine, you can explore the different levels, blueprints, and C++ code to understand how the project works.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

Currently, this repository consists of individual practice projects, each with its own specific functionalities. Explore the C++ source code and Unreal Engine Blueprints within each project folder to understand its usage.

**Example File Structure (for a project named "MyCPP_01"):**

*   `MyCPP_01/Source/MyCPP_01/`: Contains the C++ source code for the project.
*   `MyCPP_01/Content/`: Contains the assets (e.g., meshes, textures, materials) used in the project.

## Configuration Options

Configuration options will vary depending on the specific practice project. Look for configurable variables in the C++ code or within the Blueprint editor in Unreal Engine.  For example, you might find exposed variables that you can adjust in the Details panel of an Actor.
